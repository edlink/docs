On this page, you will create a connection with Schoology. This process requires that you are a Schoology administrator. If you are unsure whether or not you are a Schoology administrator, you can refer to [our guide here](/docs/administrators/schoology).

<p class="nickname">
    The first field on this page asks that you create a nickname for this Schoology connection. It doesn't have to refer to anything in particular, just choose a name that teachers and students would recognize (e.g. LAUSD Schoology).
</p>

<p class="url">
    The next field allows you to specify a custom Schoology domain where your teachers and students go to access Schoology. If your school does not have a custom domain, you can leave this field blank.
</p>

The final step is to connect your Schoology administrator account. This confirms that the above configuration is correct, and grants Edlink the required permissions to sync data with Schoology. To complete this step, click the blue "Connect" button and then select "Approve" on the following page. After approving Edlink, you will be redirected to this page, and the box will change to say "Account Connected".
