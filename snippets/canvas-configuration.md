On this page, you will create a connection with Canvas. This process requires that you are a Canvas administrator. If you are unsure whether or not you are a Canvas administrator, you can refer to [our guide here](/docs/administrators/canvas).

<p class="nickname">
    The first field on this page asks that you create a nickname for this Canvas connection. It doesn't have to refer to anything in particular, just choose a name that teachers and students would recognize (e.g. LAUSD Canvas).
</p>

<p class="url">
    The next field allows you to specify a custom Canvas domain where your teachers and students go to access Canvas. If your school does not have a custom domain, you can leave this field blank.
</p>

<p class="application_id">
    This field is the application ID that Canvas provides to you on the "Developer Keys" page. It is typically a number that is 10-20 digits long, and it will probably contain a lot of zeros.
</p>

<p class="application_secret">
    This field is the application secret that Canvas provides to you on the "Developer Keys" page. It will be hidden behind the "Show Key" button. It is usually about 64 characters long and will contain numbers and letters (both upper and lower case).
</p>

The final step is to connect your Canvas administrator account. This confirms that the above configuration is correct, and grants Edlink the required permissions to sync data with Canvas. To complete this step, click the blue "Connect" button and then select "Authorize" on the following page. After approving Edlink, you will be redirected to this page, and the box will change to say "Account Connected".
