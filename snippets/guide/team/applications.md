# Applications

Applications represent a developer's connection to Edlink. Each application has its own `Application ID` and `Secret Key`.
Applications connect with school district data `Sources` to form `Integrations`.

Some developers may choose to create multiple applications. Each application is separate from the others, and school data is not shared between different applications. This works well when your company offers multiple products, or when you
want to have separate sets of application keys for your development, testing, and production environments.

Try creating a new application by clicking `Create Application` in the top-right.
