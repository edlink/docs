# Team Settings

This page contains general settings for your team. You can manage metadata about your team (e.g. your website) or manage your team members. After you update this information, make sure you click `Save Settings` so your changes persist.

## Team Metadata

This information is displayed to users in various locations through Edlink. For example, when a user gets stuck unexpectedly, we may choose to display a link to your `Support Website`.

## Technical Contacts

These email addresses will receive automated messages when certain events happen within Edlink. For example, when a district creates or modifies an integration to an application, an email will be sent to the technical contacts from both parties informing them of the change.

# Team Members

Don't worry - you're not alone. You can always invite other members to join your team using the `Invite Team Members` button. School data is very sensitive, so only invite members of your team who are authorized to interact with it.

## Roles

There are three primary users roles in Edlink: Owner, Editor, and Viewer. These roles can help your organization limit access where necessary. Owners and editors can promote or demote users by clicking the dots to the right of their name. The team owner can transfer ownership to another member.
