# Request Details

This page contains details about a prior API request that your application sent to Edlink. This request log will be available for 30 days after the request was executed.

## Request Summary

The request summary contains technical details about the executed request. These details include the request type, method, endpoint, and originating IP address. In addition to the technical details, Edlink shows a summary of the person who executed the request (where applicable) and the district associated with the request.

## Request Body & Response Body

Where applicable, Edlink stores a full copy of the incoming request body and the outgoing response body. These are stored for several reasons:

1. To make the development process easier.
2. To help during troubleshooting.
3. To provide a historical record of API requests for legal purposes.

These fields can be very useful as they give you an exact understand of what Edlink saw (or didn't see) and how Edlink responded.
