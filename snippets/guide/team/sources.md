# Sources

Sources represent the various different systems that your school or district uses. For example, your Canvas or Skyward instance may be an Edlink `Source`. Your school may have one or multiple sources connected to various developer `Applications`. When a source is connected to a developer application, it forms an `Integration`.

Edlink allows you to tightly control access to your data sources via `Sharing Rules`. This helps you protect student privacy and ensure that developers only have access to the correct teachers and students.

Sometimes data that comes out of your LMS can be messy or incomplete. Edlink can help developers get access to the information they need to provide the best possible experience for your users. We call this process `Data Enrichment` and you can learn more about it by clicking the link below.
