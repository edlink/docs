# Application Logs

Each and every request to the Edlink API is logged for a period of 30 days. This makes it easy for application developers to debug and troubleshoot their applications.

Logged requests on this page are the same as those on your [Logs]() page, but they are filtered down to only requests made by this specific `Application` (should you have more than one).

Clicking on one of the logged requests here will take you to a page with more details. You will be able to view the source of the request, as well as the full request input (body) and output (response).
