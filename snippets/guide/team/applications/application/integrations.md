# Integrations

This page contains a list of school district `Sources` that are integrated with your application. This list is the same as the one displayed on the [Integrations]() page, but it is filtered down to only districts integrated with this particular application (should you create more than one application ID).

Clicking on one of the integrations on this page will take you to the integration overview, where you can learn more about a specific integration and browse through Edlink's dataset.
