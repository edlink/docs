# Source Settings

This page contains the technical details for your source. Once your source has been set up and is syncing successfully, it is unlikely that you'll need to access this page.

If your source configuration has changed (e.g. you've switched to a different URL, or a different LMS), then you may need to modify the settings here. Changing source settings will not immediately impact teachers and students. Instead, changes typically take effect on the next `Sync`.

## Disconnecting a Source

This page also allows you to permanently disconnect a data source. This is used most often when your school switches providers, or when you are no longer using Edlink for any vendor integrations. Please note: when you opt to delete a source, it will remove all associated developer `Integrations`. It may take us 24-48 hours to permanently remove your connection.

After your connection has been deleted, neither Edlink, nor the developer will have any access to your data. All data that we store is permanently and irreversibly deleted.
