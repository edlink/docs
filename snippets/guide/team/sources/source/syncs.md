# Source Syncs

Edlink stays in sync with your data source in order to provide up-to-date roster data to your software vendors. The page contains historical information about previous syncs. Click on a sync to view more specific details about it.

If you believe that your data is out of date, you can initiate a new sync. This process may take some time, depending on the size of your school, and its placement in the queue.

Once in a while, a sync may fail. This can happen for no particular reason (e.g. it could be the result of an outage in your data source). If your syncs are repeatly failing, it is likely a configuration problem and you should reach out to our team for help!
