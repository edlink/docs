# Logs

Edlink stores a copy of every API request it receives and every response body it returns. In addition to the request and response body, Edlink also stores some metadata about the request for later reference.

These requests can make development, debugging, and troubleshooting user issues considerably easier as they provide a huge level of transparency into what is happening within Edlink.

## Viewing Requests by Integration

To view requests for only a specific district integration, you should first go to the `Integrations` page and click on the desired integration. Towards the right side, there will be tab called `Requests`. This view will be filtered to only requests from that specific integration you're viewing.
