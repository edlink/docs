Data sources are the services that schools use to maintain data about themselves and their end users. Common types of school data sources include Learning Management Systems and Student Information Systems. Some popular data source services include [Canvas](https://canvas.instructure.com/login/canvas), [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/teams), [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/), and [Schoology](https://www.schoology.com/), though there are several more.

Edlink allows you to select which data sources can [integrate](/docs/dashboard/dev-integrations) with your application. For example, your application may have functions, such as assignment creation, which are only applicable to specific data sources which can perform those functions.

To view and modify the data sources which can integrate with your application, select ***Applications*** from the navigation header, choose an application from the list, and select ***Keys & Permissions*** from the navigation sidebar. The list of supported data sources will appear near the bottom of the page (below *Application Keys* and *Permissions*). After selecting which data sources will be supported by your application, select **Save Source Providers**.

Currently, Edlink supports integration with the following data sources:

- **[Canvas by Instructure](https://www.instructure.com/)**
- **[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/teams)** (includes services such as Outlook, Microsoft Graph, and Teams for Education)
