The ***General*** menu also allows you to manage your **Team Members**. If you created a team, you will be the designated Owner of the team. To [invite a team member](/docs/dashboard/invitations), select **Invite Team Member**. In the pop-up that appears, enter the email address of the new team member and select which permissions you wish to grant the user: *View and Edit* or *View Only*. Once a member has been added to your team, you may select the ellipsis next to their account under **Team Members** to change their permissions or to kick them from your team.
