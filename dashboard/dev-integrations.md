Integrations allow schools to make a connection between their [data source](/docs/dashboard/data-sources-dev) and your application. This connection will allow their users to sign into your application, as well as allow your application to read, create, update, or delete data from their data source (depending on the [permissions](/docs/dashboard/application-permissions-school) you granted in your application).

In order to send a school a request to integrate with their data source, select ***Applications*** from the navigation header and choose an application from the list. The **Request Integration** button will appear to the right of your application's name.

A pop-up will appear that will ask you to enter the email address of the school administrator and an optional customized message. After entering the email address and message, select **Send Integration Request**. This will email the administrator with instructions on how to set up their account (if one has not been created) and how to integrate with your application. Alternatively, you may manually send the administrator the provided **Integration Link** that appears at the bottom of the pop-up.
