Edlink allows you to change several settings about your application, including the following:

- **Application Name**
- **Description**
- **Latest Version**
- **Application Icon** (A square icon that is 200 x 200 pixels is ideal)
- **Application Banner** (A banner that is 600 x 1200 pixels is ideal)

To view and modify these settings, select ***Applications*** from the navigation header, choose an application from the list under *Applications*, and select ***Settings*** in the navigation sidebar. Be sure to save your changes when finished.

The ***Settings*** page also allows you to destroy your application. This process is irreversible and will delete all associated integrations. The data from the application will also be scrubbed from our databases and any integrated schools will no longer have access. To do so, select **Destroy Application** at the bottom of the ***Settings*** page.
