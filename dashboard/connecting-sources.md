<!-- Data sources are the services that schools use to maintain data about themselves and their end users. Common types of school data sources include Learning Management Systems and Student Information Systems. Some popular data source services include [Canvas](https://canvas.instructure.com/login/canvas), [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/teams), [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/), and [Schoology](https://www.schoology.com/), though there are several more.

You can manage your data sources to Edlink by selecting ***Sources*** from the navigation header.

To connect a new data source, select **Connect Data Source**. Select your data source that you would like to connect to Edlink. Currently, Edlink supports the following data sources:

- **[Canvas by Instructure](https://www.instructure.com/)]**
- **[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/teams)** (includes services such as Outlook, Microsoft Graph, and Teams for Education)

Next, configure your data source. Each data source requires different information in order to connect the source to Edlink. -->
