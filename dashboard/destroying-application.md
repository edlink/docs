Destroying your application is an irreversible process that will delete all associated [integrations](/docs/dashboard/dev-integrations). The data from the application will also be scrubbed from our databases and any integrated schools will no longer have access.

To destroy your application, select ***Applications*** from the navigation header and choose the application you wish to destroy. Select ***Settings*** in the navigation sidebar, scroll to the bottom of the page (past *Application Settings*), and click **Destroy Application**.
