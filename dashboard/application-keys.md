When an application is created, an Application ID and Secret Key are automatically generated. To view these, select ***Applications*** from the navigation header. Next, select the application you want to view from your list of applications.

Select ***Keys and Permissions*** from the navigation sidebar. The **Application ID** and **Secret Key** will appear under *Application Keys*. The Application ID and Secret Key must be shared with the school you want to integrate with in order for their administrators to access your application.

There is also a field below *Application Keys* to allow you to change or add redirect URIs for users who are accessing your application with an oAuth token. You may add multiple redirect URIs by entering the additional URI on a new line in the provided textbox. Be sure to save your redirect URIs when finished.
