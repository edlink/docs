Integrations allow you to make a connection between your [data source](/docs/dashboard/connecting-sources) and third-party applications. These connections will allow your users to sign into these applications, as well as allow the applications to read, create, update, or delete data from your data source (depending on the [permissions](/docs/dashboard/application-permissions-school) requested by the applications).

To enable an integration between an application and your organization's data source, access the [***Marketplace***](/docs/dashboard/marketplace) tab in the navigation header. Search for and select the application you want to integrate with your data source. Review the profile of the application, which includes the following:

- The developer of the application;
- The description of the application;
- The price of enabling the integration between your data source and the application;
- The list of data sources that will integrate with the application; and
- The list of [permissions](/docs/dashboard/application-permissions-school) that the application will be given if the integration is enabled.

Select **Enable Application** if you wish to enable the integration between the application and your data source.
