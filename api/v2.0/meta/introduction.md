# Edlink Meta API

> Version 2.0 of the Edlink Meta API will be available in Spring 2022.

The Edlink Meta API allows for deep customizations to be built on top of the Edlink platform. The Edlink Dashboard (what you're looking at right now) is not privileged in any way; anything that you see here can also be built by an external developer. The Meta API isn't designed for you to access school data. Rather, it's designed for the management of Edlink *metadata*.

## Meta API Use Cases

Some examples of what you might want to do with the Edlink Meta API are:

* You may want to build your own administrator onboarding flow instead of using Edlink's out of the box flow.
* You may want to programmatically add, update, or delete Sharing Rules.
* You may want to manage overrides or integration status via an automated process.
