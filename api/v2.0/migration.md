## Lexical Updates
As you know, naming is one of the most important parts of
software development. A good name can be the difference between
frustration and clarity.

We know that name changes can be jarring, but we've done our best
to make the transition as smooth as possible. We hope you'll
find the new names to be more clear and more consistent with other
education systems.

### Organizations
v1.0's **[Organizations](../v1.0/models/organization)** have been split into several new types in v2.0.
 * **[Districts](models/external/district)**
 * **[Schools](models/external/school)**
 * **[Classes](models/external/class)**
 * **[Sections](models/external/section)**

### Courses
**[v1.0's Courses](../v1.0/models/course)** have been renamed to **[Classes](models/external/class)** to fall more in line with industry expectations.

## New Features
Of course, with a new major version comes new features. You may want to look over these and see how they could be useful in your product.

### Results Filtering
We've added a new system to filter results in your API v2.0 requests. Please review [our guide on filtering results](../../guides/v2.0/filtering-results) for an in-depth look.
