# Migration from v1.0
So, you're thinking about making the move to v2.0â€” congratulations!

## Lexical Updates
As you know, naming is one of the most important parts of
software development. A good name can be the difference between
frustration and clarity.

We know that name changes can be jarring, but we've done our best
to make the transition as smooth as possible. We hope you'll
find the new names to be more clear and more consistent with other
education systems.

### Organizations
v1.0's **[Organizations](../v1.0/models/organization)** have been split into several new types in v2.0.
 * **[Districts](models/external/district)**
 * **[Schools](models/external/school)**
