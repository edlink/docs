The Edlink API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. The purpose of this API is to enable educational software developers to quickly connect to a variety of school data sources in order to provide a smooth workflow for teachers, students, and administrators.

Edlink data connections create an instant bi-directional data flow between your platform and the school's LMS, SIS, or related system. By drawing information from, and sending information to the LMS, your developers can build rich experiences that fit seamlessly into existing classroom environments, with virtually no setup time on the part of the teacher or administrator.

We strive to support as many different data sources and standards as possible. By doing the heavy-lifting up front, we can provide our partners with integration capabilities that are far beyond what any given standard can currently provide. Currently, we are compatible with various API, LTI, and OneRoster implementations.

<!-- We also offer a variety of endpoints that mirror common data providers ([Classlink](/docs/graph/classlink) and [Clever](/docs/graph/clever)) to help you maximize any prior investment that you made into data integration. -->

### Graph API Overview

* The Edlink Graph API provides access to bulk school data through a single set of endpoints.
* The Edlink Graph API connects to a variety of school data sources, such as the school's LMS, SIS, etc.
* The Edlink Graph API is bi-directional and can retrieve data as well as post data to school systems.
* The Edlink Graph API limits your exposure to unnecessary or sensitive student data.

If you're looking for details on working with individual user data, please check out the [Edlink User API](/docs/user/introduction).

### Conclusion

The Edlink Graph API provides a fast and easy way to integrate your platform with school data sources like the LMS or SIS. Instead of receiving raw student and teacher data on a nightly basis, you are able to interact with the LMS on-the-fly and in a bi-directional manner.
