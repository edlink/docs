Clever connections are not managed through the Edlink dashboard (although they may be available on a read-only basis). In order to create, modify, or remove a connection between a vendor and Clever, you should log into your Clever school administrator panel. Edlink does not have special access to your Clever data. It has only the data that you authorize the software vendor to access. As soon as you remove a connection from Clever, Edlink will remove the connection to the vendor and scrub all data related to your school or district.
