Classlink connections are not managed through the Edlink dashboard (although they may be available on a read-only basis). In order to create, modify, or remove a connection between a vendor and Classlink, you should log into your Classlink school administrator panel. Edlink does not have special access to your Classlink data. It has only the data that you authorize the software vendor to access. As soon as you remove a connection from Classlink, Edlink will remove the connection to the vendor and scrub all data related to your school or district.
