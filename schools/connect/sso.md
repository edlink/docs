Edlink enables single sign on with a number of popular learning management systems, student information systems, and other software vendors like G Suite, and Microsoft Office 365. Authentication is provided through these systems so your users don't need new usernames or passwords. In addition, Edlink support launches from popular SSO platforms such as Clever and Classlink, as well as launches via LTI.

### Handling Custom Domains

If your school uses a custom domain name or vanity URL in order to access your LMS or Microsoft installation, this is no problem at all. During the integration setup process, Edlink will ask for your school's custom URL when applicable. All login requests (and subsequent data requests) will be routed to this custom URL. This is especially useful when your school uses a vanity URL to automatically route users to a third-party SSO server when they try to access your LMS.

### Self-Hosted LMSs

Edlink can handle a variety of cloud-hosted or self-hosted learning management systems. If your school hosts its own Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard, or Brightspace instance, you can still connect to Edlink. The setup process will prompt you for the information necessary to complete the integration.

### Does Edlink Support My Authentication Provider?
