#### FAQ: I entered my email address in the login page. When I came back to the application, I was signed in as the wrong person.

This is a rare occurrence that could happen if you are using a shared computer. If you are currently signed in on your computer as another user in your learning management system (LMS) or data provider, you will continue into the application as that user even if you provided your own email address in the login page.

To correct this, log out of the current user's account in the LMS or data provider. Then, restart the login process using your own email address and credentials.



#### FAQ: Why did I receive a **Sign In Error**?

There are several reasons why you may have received this message after attempting to log into the application, including the following:
- The administrator of your learning management system (LMS) or data provider has not authorized the application to access your account. Contact your school's IT administrator to request access.

- You may have chosen to sign in with a different account that does not have access to the application. Contact your school's IT administrator to make sure that you are authenticating with your proper account.



#### FAQ: Why is the application showing me old course information?

The administrator of your learning management system (LMS) or data provider chooses how frequently some data is synced between your LMS/data provider and the application. Typically, this is done once a day. However, your administrator may choose to sync less frequently. User accounts, courses, and enrollments are all information that is synced periodically.

Once the sync is performed, the information that appears in your LMS or data provider should mirror the information that appears in the application.


#### FAQ: How do I login if I do not have an email address?

If you are trying to sign into an application using your credentials to your learning management system (LMS) or data provider and you do not use an email address, you must first select **Click here to find your school.** from the login page.

If you cannot find your school or you are not shown the login page to your LMS or data provider after selecting a school, please contact your administrator.

#### FAQ: I have forgotten my password.

Edlink does not store nor have access to the password that you use to log into your learning management system (LMS) or data provider. If you have forgotten your password for your LMS or data provider, you will need to go through the password reset process that your LMS administrator has implemented for your school. Please contact the administrator of your school's LMS or data provider if you need additional information on resetting your password.

#### FAQ: My administrator has authorized my school to access the application but I cannot access the app.

This may occur if your administrator has authorized some users at your school to access the app, but not your account. For example, if you are a 5th grade teacher and the administrator has only given access to 6th grade teachers, you will not be able to access the app. Please contact the administrator of your LMS or data provider to request access to the app.
