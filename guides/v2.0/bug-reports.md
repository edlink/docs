# Reporting Bugs

Though we try our best, you may encounter bugs in the Edlink API every once in a while. We really appreciate the help that we get from our clients identifying and informing us of issues that they come across.

If you think you've encountered an issue, please reach out to your primary Edlink contact, or submit an issue via the [form here]() (bonus points if you can reliably reproduce the issue). After we fire our QA guy, we'll get right on fixing it and let you know when a patch as been released!
