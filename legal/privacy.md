Edlink ("Edlink," "we," or "us") understands that privacy is tremendously important to our online visitors to our website ("Website Visitors"), to schools who use our Service ("Schools"), and to students whose information we may access on behalf of a School ("Students"). As we describe below, Schools decide which data is integrated with Edlink, and Schools are responsible for determining whether data is ever shared with applications through Edlink. This privacy policy applies to our website https://ed.link/ and to the Edlink platform (our "Service") and describes the steps we take to protect your data.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our Terms of Use.

## 1. How We Collect and Use Information

We collect the following types of information:

**Information about Schools:** We ask for certain information when a School administrator registers a School with Edlink, or if the administrator corresponds with us online, including a name, school name, school district, school email address and/or account name and password, phone number, message content, and information relating to the School's information systems. We may also retain information provided by a School if the School sends us a message, posts content to our website or through our Service, or responds to emails or surveys. Once a School begins using the Edlink Service, we will collect content and information provided by the School through the School's use of the Service and we will keep records of activities related to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of the Service, to analyze and improve our Service offerings and functionality, and to communicate with our Schools and website visitors.

**Student Data:** Through the course of providing its Service to a School, Edlink may have access to personally identifiable information (“PII”) about students ("Student Data") that is provided by the School, by the parent or guardian, or by the Student. Depending on the Service selected by the School, a School may authorize Edlink to receive Student Data from the learning application(s) used by the School. Edlink has access to Student Data only as requested by the School and only for the purposes of performing Services on the School's behalf.

The type of Student Data we collect will depend on how the School uses the Service and the applications which the School connects through the Service. Student PII that Schools may share with Edlink include the student's full name, display name, email address, phone number, date of birth and system/school/state agency identification numbers. Student Data is only collected as needed to perform the Service and/or at the direction of the School.

In many instances, Edlink receives Student Data only from the School and never interacts with the Student directly. In some instances, depending on the level of Edlink's Service selected by the School, the Schools may allow Students to log into the Edlink Service to access third party applications that have been authorized by the School. In that instance, the School provides each student with login credentials and confirms that it has obtained appropriate parental consents, as needed, before the student is permitted to access the Service.

We consider Student Data to be confidential and do not use such data for any purpose other than to provide the services on the School's behalf, in accordance with contractual agreements with the School. Our collection, use, and disclosure of Student Data is governed by our Terms of Use, our Additional Terms of Use for Schools, and/or any other agreement with the School, by the provision of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and applicable state laws which relate to the collection of Student Data. If you are a Student or parent, please contact your School if you have questions about the School's use of technology service providers like Edlink.

**Information about Parents:** Depending on the Service selected by the School, a School may authorize Edlink to receive data about a student’s parent or legal guardian (a “Parent”). We consider Parent Data to be confidential and do not use such data for any purpose other than to provide the services on the School's behalf, in accordance with contractual agreements with the School.

**Information collected through technology:** Like most websites and online services, we and our third party partners automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our Services, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, file information and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”). For example, we collect information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, device type, operating system, date and time stamp, and other such information. We may be able to determine your approximate location by analyzing like an IP address to associate a user with their School. We may also collect analytics data to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.

Cookies and related technology allow us to provide you with a better user experience. For example, we may use the data collected through cookies to: (a) remember information so that a user will not have to re-enter it during subsequent visits; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to identify you across multiple devices; (d) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and usage on our website and our Service; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; (g) help users efficiently access information after signing in, and (h) otherwise to plan for and enhance our Service

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Service, as some features and services on our Service may not work properly. Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. You may also set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and performed certain functions with it.

**Third Party Tracking:** We do not permit third party advertising networks to collect information about your use of our website and Service over time and across websites for the purpose of serving targeted advertising, and we will never use Student Data for targeted advertising.

## 2. How We Share Your Information

Edlink only shares personal information in a few limited circumstances, described below. We do not rent or sell information for marketing purposes and we will never share or sell Student Data with third parties for marketing purposes.

**Who we may share information with:**
* We share information within the Service as needed to perform the Service and/or at the direction of the School. For example, information including Student Data, will be shared between and among authorized School users such as teachers and School administrators. This sharing will depend on the settings and functionality selected by the School.
* We may share information with our trusted third party service providers who perform technology services on our behalf (e.g. web hosting and analytics services), but strictly for the purpose of carrying out their work for us. Contractors and service providers who may have access to Student Data in the course of performing their services are subject to confidentiality and data security requirements. We only share student data with third party service providers that are consistent with Edlink’s policies.
* We may be required to share information with law enforcement or other third parties when compelled to do so by court order or other legal process, to comply with statutes or regulations, to enforce our Terms of Use, or if we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users.
* We may share information in an aggregated and/or anonymous form that does not reasonably identify an individual or School. For example, we may use and share aggregate or anonymized data to study and improve our Service, user functionality, and product offerings.

**In the event of a change of control:** If we sell, divest or transfer our business, we will not transfer personal information of our customers unless the new owner intends to maintain and provide the Service as a going concern, and provided that the new owner has agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than our own. In such a case we will provide you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of personally identifiable Student Data.

**How Student Data is shared:** In addition to the actions described above, Edlink may facilitate the sharing of Student Data with third parties, though only when instructed and authorized to do so on behalf of the School. Some elements of our Service enable Schools to interact with parents, students, teachers and third party applications, for the benefit of the student’s education. Edlink does not facilitate the sharing of any Student Data with third parties on the Service except on behalf of the School after the School has authorized a third party or application to access Student Data through the Service. Please remember that this Privacy Policy applies to the Edlink Services, and not other services or third party applications, which may have their own privacy policies. Schools should carefully read the privacy practices of each third party application before agreeing to engage with the application through the Service.

We store our data in the United States and we take strong measures to keep data safe and secure.

## 3. How We Store and Protect Your Information

**Storage and processing:** Any information collected through the Service is stored and processed in the United States. If you use our Service outside of the United States, you consent to have your data transferred to the United States.

**Keeping information safe:** Edlink maintains strict administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers, which are located in the United States. Access to information is limited (through user/password credentials and two factor authentication) to those employees who require it to perform their job functions. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to safeguard your data during transit. In addition, we use industry-standard LUKS encryption to safeguard data at rest. Other security safeguards include but are not limited to: firewalls, and physical access controls to buildings and files.

**Unauthorized disclosure:** If there is any disclosure or access to any personally identifiable Student Data by an unauthorized party, we will promptly notify the affected School(s) and will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with their investigation of the incident.

## 4. Your Choices About Your Information

**Account information and settings:** Schools may update account information and modify Services by signing into the administrator account. Schools and other website visitors can opt-out of receiving promotional email from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” feature at the bottom of each email. You cannot unsubscribe from Service-related messaging.

If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying account information, contact us directly at privacy@ed.link.

**Access to Student Data:** Student Data is provided and controlled by the Schools. If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting personal information of a student, please contact your School directly.

**How long we keep User Content:** Following termination or deactivation of a School account, Edlink may retain profile information and content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes, but any and all Student Data associated with the School will be deleted promptly. We may maintain anonymized or aggregated data, including usage data, for analytics purposes. If you have any questions about data retention or deletion, please [contact us](/support).

## 5. Children's Privacy

Edlink does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 unless and until the School has obtained appropriate parental consent for the student to use the Service. Because Edlink collects and uses Student Data at the direction of and under the control of a School, Edlink relies on each School to provide appropriate notice to parents of the School's use of third party service providers such as Edlink, and for the Schools to provide consent, if necessary, and authorization for Edlink to collect Student Data, as permitted by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Please contact us at privacy@ed.link if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child under 13 without proper consent so that we may delete such data as soon as possible.

## 6. Links to Other Websites and Services

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites, applications or services linked to or from our Service. We recommend that the School review the privacy policies of other applications before authorizing a third party to access data through the Service. While we do not accept liability from damages caused by third party applications, we do actively monitor data transmitted to these applications for signs of misuse.

## 7. How to Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the Service, we recommend contacting us at [https://ed.link/support](/support) or sending us an e-mail at privacy@ed.link.

If a Student contacts Edlink with a question about our Service, we will collect personal information from that Student only as necessary to respond to the Student's request and direct the Student to contact the Student's School, and we will then delete or anonymize the personal data of the Student after providing our response.

## 8. Jurisdiction-Specific Disclosures

We may be required by law to provide additional privacy disclosures, depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside. Please refer below for disclosures that may be applicable to you:

* **California:** If you are a California resident, please view our [Privacy Disclosures for California Residents](/docs/legal/california-residents).

* **Nevada:** Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes permits a Nevada resident to opt out of future sales of certain covered information that a website operator has collected or will collect about the Nevada resident. We do not engage in data “sales” as defined by the Nevada law. However, if you would like to submit a request to opt-out of future sales (if any), please contact us directly by visiting our Help Center. You can also email us at privacy@ed.link with the subject line “Nevada opt-out."

## 9. Changes to Our Privacy Policy

Edlink may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time so you should review this page periodically. If we change the policy in a material manner, for example if we seek to use personal information in a materially different way than we had previously, we will provide at least 30 days notice to the Schools so that you have sufficient time to evaluate the change in practice. This notice will be provided in the form of a prominent statement stating that the policy has been changed the first time the user logs into Edlink following the change. This notice will also state that users are providing consent by continuing to use the service. Of course, you can always opt-out by deleting your account before the changes take effect.
