With all requests to Edlink, we require that you provide your Edlink secret key. You can read more about the API key and how to properly attach it to your requests [on the equivalent document in the Graph API section](/docs/graph/authorization). The primary reason that we require this API key, even when making requests with a [user's bearer token](/docs/user/authentication), is to safeguard user data and ensure that a token is only being used the application to which it was issued.
