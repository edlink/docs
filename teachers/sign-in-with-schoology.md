This application uses Edlink to sign in users. Edlink works with your school administrator to allow you to sign into the application using your Schoology account. Your Schoology account will either be in the form of an email address or in the form of a non-email username. Please contact your school administrator if you do not know how to sign into your Schoology account. ***DO NOT CREATE AN EDLINK ACCOUNT.***

Please follow the instructions below based on the type of Schoology account you use.

#### My Schoology account is connected to an email address
If your Schoology account is connected to your email address, enter your email address into the provided **Email Address** field and select **Continue**.

After entering your email address, you will be brought to the Schoology login page. Log into Schoology as you normally would with your email address.

*Please note that your school may authenticate you into Schoology using a third-party single-sign on (SSO) provider. For example, your school's Schoology instance may be set up so that you log into Schoology by first logging into your school-assigned Google account. This process will not change and you will still have to authenticate into Schoology using the third-party SSO provider in order to access the application.*

If this is your first time logging into the application, you will see a prompt requesting that Edlink access your account. Please note that you will also see this prompt if you have logged out of Schoology since the last time you logged into the application. Select **Authorize** to continue logging in. You should now be logged into the application.

#### My Schoology account is in the form of a non-email username
If your Schoology account is not connected to your email address, you will instead login using the username and password that you use to sign into Schoology. Select **Don't have an email address?** from the login page.

In the **Find Your School...** field, enter the name of your school. If your administrator has authorized the application, your school will appear in the list below the field.
