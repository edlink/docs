This application uses Edlink to sign in users. Edlink works with your school administrator to allow you to sign into the application using your school-assigned Google account. Your Google account will be in the form of an email address. Please contact your school administrator if you do not know how to sign into your Google account. ***DO NOT CREATE AN EDLINK ACCOUNT.***

### Logging in with Google
If your school uses an email domain hosted by Google (e.g. Gmail), G Suite for Education, or Google Classroom, you will use your school-assigned Google account to log into the application. Enter your school-assigned email address into the provided **Email Address** field select **Continue**.

After entering your email address, you will be brought to the Google login page. Log into Google as you normally would with your school-assigned email address.

If this is your first time logging into the application, you will see a prompt requesting that Edlink access your account. Please note that you will also see this prompt if you have logged out of Google since the last time you logged into the application. Select **Allow** to continue logging in. You should now be logged into the application.

### Signing back into the application
If you have logged out of the application and wish to log back in, navigate back to the application's sign in page. You will see a list of accounts that you have already authorized Edlink to access.
From this page, you may choose the following options:
- Select the listed account that you wish to use to access the application.
- Select **Use a different account** to log into the application with a different account or data provider. This will bring you back to the beginning of the login process.
- Select **Sign Out Of All Accounts** to revoke Edlink's access to your account. This will bring you back to the beginning of the login process.
