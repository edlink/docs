This application uses Edlink to sign in users. Edlink works with your school administrator to allow you to sign into the application using your Brightspace account. Your Brightspace account will either be in the form of an email address or in the form of a non-email username. Please contact your school administrator if you do not know how to sign into your Schoology account. ***DO NOT CREATE AN EDLINK ACCOUNT.***

Please follow the instructions below based on the type of Brightspace account you use.

#### My Brightspace account is connected to an email address
If your Brightspace account is connected to your email address, enter your email address into the provided **Email Address** field.
