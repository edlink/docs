This application uses Edlink to sign in users. Edlink works with your school administrator to allow you to sign into the application using your Moodle account. Your Moodle account will either be in the form of an email address or in the form of a non-email username. Please contact your school administrator if you do not know how to sign into your Moodle account. ***DO NOT CREATE AN EDLINK ACCOUNT.***

Please follow the instructions below based on the type of Moodle account you use.

#### My Moodle account is connected to an email address
If your Moodle account is connected to your email address, enter your email address into the provided **Email Address** field and select **Continue**.

After entering your email address, you will be brought to the login page for your school's Moodle instance. Log into Moodle as you normally would with your email address. You should now be logged into the application.

#### My Moodle account is in the form of a non-email username
If your Moodle account is not connected to your email address, you will instead login using the username and password that you use to sign into Moodle. Select **Don't have an email address?** from the login page.
