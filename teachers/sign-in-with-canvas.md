This application uses Edlink to sign in users. Edlink works with your school administrator to allow you to sign into the application using your Canvas account. Your Canvas account will either be in the form of an email address or in the form of a non-email username. Please contact your school administrator if you do not know how to sign into your Canvas account. ***DO NOT CREATE AN EDLINK ACCOUNT.***

Please follow the instructions below based on the type of Canvas account you use.

### My Canvas account is connected to an email address
If your Canvas account is connected to your email address, enter your email address into the provided **Email Address** field.

After entering your email address, you will be brought to the login page for your school's Canvas instance. Log into Canvas as you normally would with your email address.

*Please note that your school may authenticate you into Canvas using a third-party single-sign on (SSO) provider. For example, your school's Canvas instance may be set up so that you log into Canvas by first logging into your school-assigned Google account. This process will not change and you will still have to authenticate into Canvas using the third-party SSO provider in order to access the application.*

If this is your first time logging into the application, you will see a prompt requesting that Edlink access your account. Please note that you will also see this prompt if you have logged out of Canvas since the last time you logged into the application. Select **Authorize** to continue logging in. You should now be logged into the application.

### My Canvas account is in the form of a non-email username
If your Canvas account is not connected to your email address, you will instead login using the username and password that you use to sign into Canvas. Select **Don't have an email address?** from the login page.

In the **Find Your School...** field, enter the name of your school. If your administrator has authorized the application, your school will appear in the list below the field.

Select your school from the list.
